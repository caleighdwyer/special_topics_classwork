## Lasso

Notes:

Regression is estimated using the data likelihood 
minb[RSS(b)] RSS is residual sum of squares

Lasso adds a penalty on the sum of all coefficients:
minb[RSS(b)+Yp(b)] 

Estimation is now a balance between overall fit and coefficient size (you don't want coefficients that are too big)

difficult to get p-values out of lasso. (no inference). don't trust someone's p values that they report out of a lasso regression. Very little/difficult interpretation (coefficients aren't interpeted the same as regular regression)
